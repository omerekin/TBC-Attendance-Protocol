# TBC-Attendance-Protocol

**About** <br />
Web3 represents a paradigm shift of user controlled data where users are rewarded for their community participation and incentives are put in place to retain an active user base. At Tufts Blockchain, we aspire and strive to do the same.  Hence the purpose of this project is to reward user interaction with the club. This protocol is the first of many to expand upon this spirit and idea. 

**Task** <br />
Design a protocol that distributes “JumboCoin” to members that fill out an attendance form online at the beginning of every meeting. JumboCoin is an ERC-20 Token on the Ethereum blockchain. To read more about ERC-20 tokens, use this link. The user should enter the following parts of information: Public Key Address and their Name pertaining to their digital wallet. After the form is completed, all details are mapped to a smart contract which represents a transaction from one member of the blockchain to another. “JumboCoin” will be launched on a test network therefore detaching any monetary value to the token. 

**What is already provided:** <br />
An HTML5 form is already provided, however backend infrastructure connecting the HTML to a smart contract is lacking and must be built out.

**Part 1:** Connect the form to Remix to autonomously distribute ERC-20 tokens to club members. <br />
**Part 2:** Create a security system to prevent members from over distributing JumboCoin to themselves during the open period of the form submission. <br />
**Part 3:** Automate the form’s submission opening and closing times to only specific dates and times that can be set in advance.
